- 4.0.1 (Hadoop 3.4.1, Scala 2.13, Python 3.11, Java 17) (Experimental)
- 3.5.6 (Hadoop 3.3.4, Scala 2.12, Python 3.11, Java 17) (Deprecated)
- 3.5.7 (Hadoop 3.3.4, Scala 2.12, Python 3.11, Java 17) (LTS)

Some reasons why Spark 4 is considered experimental (as of September 2025):

- Missing HBase compatibility (See: https://github.com/apache/hbase-connectors/pull/130)
- Executors fail to load logging libs (maybe related: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-52585)
