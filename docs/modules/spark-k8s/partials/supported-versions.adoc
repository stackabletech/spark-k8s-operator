- 4.0.1 (Hadoop 3.4.2, Scala 2.13, Python 3.12, Java 21)
- 4.1.1 (Hadoop 3.4.2, Scala 2.13, Python 3.12, Java 21) (Experimental)
- 3.5.7 (Hadoop 3.4.2, Scala 2.12, Python 3.11, Java 17) (LTS)

Some reasons why Spark 4.1.1 is considered experimental (as of January 2026):

- Missing HBase compatibility (See: https://github.com/apache/hbase-connectors/pull/130)
- No Iceberg Spark runtime release with support for Spark 4.1 available yet.
- No Delta Lake release with support for Spark 4.1 available yet.
