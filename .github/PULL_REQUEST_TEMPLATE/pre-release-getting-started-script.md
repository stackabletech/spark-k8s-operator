> [!NOTE]
> During a Stackable release we need to check (and optionally update) the
> getting-started scripts to ensure they still work after product and operator
> updates.

```shell
# Some of the scripts are in a code/ subdirectory
# pushd docs/modules/superset/examples/getting_started
# pushd docs/modules/superset/examples/getting_started/code
pushd $(fd -td getting_started | grep examples); cd code 2>/dev/null || true

# Make a fresh cluster (~12 seconds)
kind delete cluster && kind create cluster
./getting_started.sh stackablectl

# Make a fresh cluster (~12 seconds)
kind delete cluster && kind create cluster
./getting_started.sh helm

popd
```
