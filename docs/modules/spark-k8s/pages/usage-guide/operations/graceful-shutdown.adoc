= Graceful shutdown

Normally you can configure the graceful shutdown as described in xref:concepts:operations/graceful_shutdown.adoc[].

However, the spark-k8s operator does not implement any graceful shutdown mechanism, as the driver and executor Pods are created by Spark itself.
So it's Spark responsibility to handle the shutdown and recovery of Pods.
