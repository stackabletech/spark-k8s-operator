# =============
# This file is automatically generated from the templates in stackabletech/operator-templating
# DON'T MANUALLY EDIT THIS FILE
# =============
# Similar to check_charts, this tries to render the README, and see if there are unintended changes.
# This will save us from merging changes to the wrong file (instead of the templated source), and from
# forgetting to render out modifications to the README.
