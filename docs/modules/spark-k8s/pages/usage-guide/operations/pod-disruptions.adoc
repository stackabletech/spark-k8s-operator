= Allowed Pod disruptions

== Spark applications

As Spark creates and destroys executor Pods itself, our operators don't create any PodDisruptionBudgets (PDBs).

== History servers
You can configure the permitted Pod disruptions for Spark history servers as described in xref:concepts:operations/pod_disruptions.adoc[].

Unless you configure something else or disable the provided PodDisruptionBudgets (PDBs), the created PDBs only allow a single HistoryServer to be offline at any given time, regardless of the number of replicas or `roleGroups`.
