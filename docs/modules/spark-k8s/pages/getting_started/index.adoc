= Getting started

This guide gets you started with Spark using the Stackable operator for Apache Spark.
It guides you through the installation of the operator and its dependencies, executing your first Spark job and reviewing its result.

== Prerequisites

You need:

* a Kubernetes cluster
* kubectl
* Helm

Resource sizing depends on cluster type(s), usage and scope, but as a starting point we recommend a minimum of the following resources for this operator:

* 0.2 cores (e.g. i5 or similar)
* 256MB RAM

== What's next

The Guide is divided into two steps:

* xref:getting_started/installation.adoc[Installing the Operators].
* xref:getting_started/first_steps.adoc[Starting a Spark job].
