== Overview

The https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/running-on-kubernetes.html#rbac[Spark-Kubernetes RBAC documentation] describes what is needed for `spark-submit` jobs to run successfully: minimally a role/cluster-role to allow the driver pod to create and manage executor pods.

However, to add security, each `spark-submit` job launched by the spark-k8s operator will be assigned its own service account.

When the spark-k8s operator is installed via Helm, a cluster role named `spark-k8s-clusterrole` is created with pre-defined permissions.

When a new Spark application is submitted, the operator creates a new service account with the same name as the application and binds this account to the cluster role `spark-k8s-clusterrole` created by Helm.
