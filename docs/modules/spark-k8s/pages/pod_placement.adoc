= Pod Placement

== Spark Applications

You can configure pod placement of application drivers and executors by adding an `affininty` property to the corresponding configuration section.

By default, the operator doen't configure any affinity.

== Spark History Server

You can configure the Pod placement of Spark History Server pods as described in xref:concepts:pod_placement.adoc[].

The default affinities created by the operator are:

1. Co-locate all the history pods (weight 20)
2. Distribute all pods within the same role (weight 70)
