## Issue checklist

This is a simple checklist of things to bear in mind when creating a new issue.

- [ ] **Describe the use-case**: As far as possible, use the pattern "As a [type of user], I would like [feature/functionality] to be able to do [specific action]." This helps identify the feature and the problem it addresses.
- [ ] **Indicate importance and urgency**: Use a scale (e.g., low, medium, high) to indicate the level of importance and urgency.
- [ ] **Work-around**: If there is a known work-around, describe it briefly.
- [ ] **Environment**: Describe the environment where the issue occurs (e.g., SDP version, K8S version, etc.).
