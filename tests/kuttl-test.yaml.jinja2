# The timeout (in seconds) is used when namespaces are created or
# deleted, and, if not overridden, in TestSteps, TestAsserts, and
# Commands. If not set, the timeout is 30 seconds by default.
#
# The deletion of a namespace can take a while until all resources are
# gracefully shut down. If the timeout is reached in the meantime, even
# a successful test case is considered a failure.
#
# For instance, the termination grace period of the Vector aggregator in
# the logging tests is set to 60 seconds. If there are logs entries
# which could not be forwarded yet to the external aggregator defined in
# the VECTOR_AGGREGATOR environment variable, then the test aggregator
# uses this period of time by trying to forward the events. In this
# case, deleting a namespace with several Pods takes about 90 seconds.
