== Create an Apache Spark job

If you followed the installation instructions, you should now have a Stackable Operator for Apache Spark up and running and you are ready to create your first Apache Spark kubernetes cluster.

The example below creates a job running on Apache Spark 3.2.1, using the spark-on-kubernetes paradigm described in the spark documentation. The application file is itself part of the spark distribution and `local` refers to the path on the driver/executors; there are no external dependencies.

    cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
    apiVersion: spark.stackable.tech/v1alpha1
    kind: SparkApplication
    metadata:
      name: spark-clustermode-001
    spec:
      version: 3.2.1-hadoop3.2
      mode: cluster
      mainClass: org.apache.spark.examples.SparkPi
      mainApplicationFile: local:///stackable/spark/examples/jars/spark-examples_2.12-3.2.1.jar
      image: 3.2.1-hadoop3.2
      driver:
        cores: 1
        coreLimit: "1200m"
        memory: "512m"
      executor:
        cores: 1
        instances: 3
        memory: "512m"
    EOF

== Examples

The following examples have the following `spec` fields in common:

- `version`: the current version is "1.0"
- `sparkImage`: the docker image that will be used by job, driver and executor pods. This can be provided by the user.
- `mode`: only `cluster` is currently supported
- `mainApplicationFile`: the artifact (Java, Scala or Python) that forms the basis of the Spark job.
- `args`: these are the arguments passed directly to the application. In the examples below it is e.g. the input path for part of the public New York taxi dataset.
- `sparkConf`: these list spark configuration settings that are passed directly to `spark-submit` and which are best defined explicitly by the user. Since the `SparkApplication` "knows" that there is an external dependency (the s3 bucket where the data and/or the application is located) and how that dependency should be treated (i.e. what type of credential checks are required, if any), it is better to have these things declared together.
- `volumes`: refers to any volumes needed by the `SparkApplication`, in this case an underlying `PersistentVoulmeClaim`.
- `driver`: driver-specific settings, including any volume mounts.
- `executor`: executor-specific settings, including any volume mounts.

Job-specific settings are annotated below.

=== Pyspark: externally located artifact and dataset 

[source,yaml]
----
include::example$example-sparkapp-external-dependencies.yaml[]
----

<1> Job python artifact (external)
<2> Job argument (external)
<3> List of python job requirements: these will be installed in the pods via `pip`
<4> Spark dependencies: the credentials provider (the user knows what is relevant here) plus dependencies needed to access external resources (in this case, in s3)
<5> the name of the volume mount backed by a `PersistentVolumeClaim` that must be pre-existing
<6> the path on the volume mount: this is referenced in the `sparkConf` section where the extra class path is defined for the driver and executors

=== Pyspark: externally located dataset, artifact available via PVC/volume mount

[source,yaml]
----
include::example$example-sparkapp-image.yaml[]
----

<1> Job image: this contains the job artifact that will retrieved from the volume mount backed by the PVC
<2> Job python artifact (local)
<3> Job argument (external)
<4> List of python job requirements: these will be installed in the pods via `pip`
<5> Spark dependencies: the credentials provider (the user knows what is relevant here) plus dependencies needed to access external resources (in this case, in s3)
<6> the name of the volume mount backed by a `PersistentVolumeClaim` that must be pre-existing
<7> the path on the volume mount: this is referenced in the `sparkConf` section where the extra class path is defined for the driver and executors

=== JVM (Scala): externally located artifact and dataset 

[source,yaml]
----
include::example$example-sparkapp-pvc.yaml[]
----

<1> Job artifact located on S3.
<2> Job main class
<3> Spark dependencies: the credentials provider (the user knows what is relevant here) plus dependencies needed to access external resources (in this case, in s3, accessed without credentials)
<4> the name of the volume mount backed by a `PersistentVolumeClaim` that must be pre-existing
<5> the path on the volume mount: this is referenced in the `sparkConf` section where the extra class path is defined for the driver and executors

=== JVM (Scala): externally located artifact accessed with credentials

[source,yaml]
----
include::example$example-sparkapp-s3-private.yaml[]
----

<1> Job python artifact (local)
<2> Artifact class
<3> S3 section, specifying the existing secret and S3 end-point ( in this case, Min-IO)
<4> Credentials secret
<5> Spark dependencies: the credentials provider (the user knows what is relevant here) plus dependencies needed to access external resources...
<6> ...in this case, in s3, accessed with the credentials defined in the secret
<7> the name of the volume mount backed by a `PersistentVolumeClaim` that must be pre-existing
<8> the path on the volume mount: this is referenced in the `sparkConf` section where the extra class path is defined for the driver and executors
