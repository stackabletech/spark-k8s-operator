# Updating nix dependencies

## Run the following for an operator

> [!NOTE]
> We track the `master` branch of crate2nix as that is relatively up to date, but the releases are infrequent.

```shell
niv update crate2nix
niv update nixpkgs
niv update beku.py -b X.Y.Z # Using the release tag
```

### Test

- Run make `regenerate-nix` to ensure crate2nix works
- Run a smoke test to ensure beku.py works.
- Run `make run-dev` to ensure nixpkgs are fine.

## Update operator-templating

Do the same as above, but from `template/`
