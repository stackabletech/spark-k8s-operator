## Issue checklist

This is a simple checklist of things to bear in mind when creating a new issue.

- [ ] Describe the use-case, as far is possible. For instance, using the pattern "As a XXXX, I would like XXXX to be able to do XXXX" helps to identify the feature as well as the problem it is intended to address.
- [ ] Indicate an approximate level of importance and urgency.
- [ ] Indicate if there is a known work-around until such time as the issue has been implemented.
