## About The Stackable Data Platform

This operator is written and maintained by [Stackable](https://stackable.tech) and it is part of a larger data platform.

![Stackable Data Platform Overview](./.readme/static/borrowed/sdp_overview.png)

Stackable makes it easy to operate data applications in any Kubernetes cluster.

The data platform offers many operators, new ones being added continuously. All our operators are designed and built to be easily interconnected and to be consistent to work with.

The [Stackable GmbH](https://stackable.tech/) is the company behind the Stackable Data Platform. Offering professional services, paid support plans and custom development.

We love open-source!
