= Examples

The following examples have the following `spec` fields in common:

- `version`: the current version is "1.0"
- `sparkImage`: the docker image that will be used by job, driver and executor pods. This can be provided by the user.
- `mode`: only `cluster` is currently supported
- `mainApplicationFile`: the artifact (Java, Scala or Python) that forms the basis of the Spark job.
- `args`: these are the arguments passed directly to the application. In the examples below it is e.g. the input path for part of the public New York taxi dataset.
- `sparkConf`: these list spark configuration settings that are passed directly to `spark-submit` and which are best defined explicitly by the user. Since the `SparkApplication` "knows" that there is an external dependency (the s3 bucket where the data and/or the application is located) and how that dependency should be treated (i.e. what type of credential checks are required, if any), it is better to have these things declared together.
- `volumes`: refers to any volumes needed by the `SparkApplication`, in this case an underlying `PersistentVolumeClaim`.
- `driver`: driver-specific settings, including any volume mounts.
- `executor`: executor-specific settings, including any volume mounts.

Job-specific settings are annotated below.

== Pyspark: externally located artifact and dataset

[source,yaml]
----
include::example$example-sparkapp-external-dependencies.yaml[]
----

<1> Job python artifact (external)
<2> Job argument (external)
<3> List of python job requirements: these will be installed in the pods via `pip`
<4> Spark dependencies: the credentials provider (the user knows what is relevant here) plus dependencies needed to access external resources (in this case, in s3)
<5> the name of the volume mount backed by a `PersistentVolumeClaim` that must be pre-existing
<6> the path on the volume mount: this is referenced in the `sparkConf` section where the extra class path is defined for the driver and executors

== Pyspark: externally located dataset, artifact available via PVC/volume mount

[source,yaml]
----
include::example$example-sparkapp-image.yaml[]
----

<1> Job image: this contains the job artifact that will be retrieved from the volume mount backed by the PVC
<2> Job python artifact (local)
<3> Job argument (external)
<4> List of python job requirements: these will be installed in the pods via `pip`
<5> Spark dependencies: the credentials provider (the user knows what is relevant here) plus dependencies needed to access external resources (in this case, in an S3 store)

== JVM (Scala): externally located artifact and dataset

[source,yaml]
----
include::example$example-sparkapp-pvc.yaml[]
----

<1> Job artifact located on S3.
<2> Job main class
<3> Spark dependencies: the credentials provider (the user knows what is relevant here) plus dependencies needed to access external resources (in this case, in an S3 store, accessed without credentials)
<4> the name of the volume mount backed by a `PersistentVolumeClaim` that must be pre-existing
<5> the path on the volume mount: this is referenced in the `sparkConf` section where the extra class path is defined for the driver and executors

== JVM (Scala): externally located artifact accessed with credentials

[source,yaml]
----
include::example$example-sparkapp-s3-private.yaml[]
----

<1> Job python artifact (located in an S3 store)
<2> Artifact class
<3> S3 section, specifying the existing secret and S3 end-point (in this case, MinIO)
<4> Credentials referencing a secretClass (not shown in is example)
<5> Spark dependencies: the credentials provider (the user knows what is relevant here) plus dependencies needed to access external resources...
<6> ...in this case, in an S3 store, accessed with the credentials defined in the secret

== JVM (Scala): externally located artifact accessed with job arguments provided via configuration map

[source,yaml]
----
include::example$example-configmap.yaml[]
----
[source,yaml]
----
include::example$example-sparkapp-configmap.yaml[]
----
<1> Name of the configuration map
<2> Argument required by the job
<3> Job scala artifact that requires an input argument
<4> The volume backed by the configuration map
<5> The expected job argument, accessed via the mounted configuration map file
<6> The name of the volume backed by the configuration map that will be mounted to the driver/executor
<7> The mount location of the volume (this will contain a file `/arguments/job-args.txt`)
