> [!NOTE]
> During a Stackable release we need to update various Rust dependencies before
> entering the final release period to ensure we run the latest versions of
> crates. These bumps also include previously updated and released crates from
> the `operator-rs` repository.

```[tasklist]
### Tasks
- [ ] Bump Rust Dependencies, see below for more details.
- [ ] Add changelog entry stating which important crates were bumped (including the version).
```

> [!NOTE]
> The bumping / updating of Rust dependencies is done in multiple steps:
>
> 1. Update the minimum Version in the root `Cargo.toml` manifest.
> 2. Run the `cargo update` command, which also updates the `Cargo.lock` file.
> 3. Lastly, run `make regenerate-nix` to update the `Cargo.nix` file.

```[tasklist]
### Bump Rust Dependencies
- [ ] Bump `stackable-operator` and friends.
- [ ] Bump `product-version`.
- [ ] Bump all other dependencies.
```
