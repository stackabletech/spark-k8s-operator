= S3 bucket specification

You can specify S3 connection details directly inside the `SparkApplication` specification or by referring to an external `S3Bucket` custom resource.

== S3 access using credentials

To specify S3 connection details directly as part of the `SparkApplication` resource you add an inline connection configuration as shown below.

[source,yaml]
----
s3connection: # <1>
  inline:
    host: test-minio # <2>
    port: 9000 # <3>
    accessStyle: Path
    credentials:
      secretClass: s3-credentials-class  # <4>
----
<1> Entry point for the S3 connection configuration.
<2> Connection host.
<3> Optional connection port.
<4> Name of the `Secret` object expected to contain the following keys: `accessKey` and `secretKey`

It is also possible to configure the  connection details as a separate Kubernetes resource and only refer to that object from the `SparkApplication` like this:

[source,yaml]
----
s3connection:
  reference: s3-connection-resource # <1>
----
<1> Name of the connection resource with connection details.

The resource named `s3-connection-resource` is then defined as shown below:

[source,yaml]
----
---
apiVersion: s3.stackable.tech/v1alpha1
kind: S3Connection
metadata:
  name: s3-connection-resource
spec:
  host: test-minio
  port: 9000
  accessStyle: Path
  credentials:
    secretClass: minio-credentials-class
----

This has the advantage that one connection configuration can be shared across `SparkApplications` and reduces the cost of updating these details.

== S3 access with TLS

A custom certificate can also be used for S3 access. In the example below, a Secret containing a custom certificate is referenced, which will used a to create a custom truststore which is used by Spark for S3-bucket access:

[source,yaml]
----
---
apiVersion: s3.stackable.tech/v1alpha1
kind: S3Connection
metadata:
  name: s3-connection-resource
spec:
  host: test-minio
  port: 9000
  accessStyle: Path
  credentials:
    secretClass: minio-credentials-class  # <1>
  tls:
    verification:
      server:
        caCert:
          secretClass: minio-tls-certificates  # <2>
----
<1> Name of the `Secret` object expected to contain the following keys: `accessKey` and `secretKey` (as in the previous example).
<2> Name of the `Secret` object containing the custom certificate. The certificate should comprise the 3 files named as shown below:

[source,yaml]
----
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: minio-tls-certificates
  labels:
    secrets.stackable.tech/class: minio-tls-certificates
data:
  ca.crt: ...
  tls.crt: ...
  tls.key: ...
